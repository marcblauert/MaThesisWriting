# Conclusion {#conclusion}

This thesis investigated short-term price elasticities of space heating demand based on a large-scale sample of energy bills in Germany in the period between 2007 and 2019. The estimation of price elasticities of space heating demand is of relevance as it is a key parameter for assessing the expected impact of price-related energy policy instruments, such as the newly introduced Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) 2021 in Germany. The novelty of this work is that it relies on energy billing data instead of social survey data, which provides a more accurate picture of energy demand and prices than previous studies, which usually use information on household expenditures and average price data from national statistics to derive demand [e.g., @rehdanz07; @schmitz_madlener20]. Furthermore, this thesis relies on a broad range of statistical methods and applies Bayesian regression analysis with a multilevel partial pooling approach on a subsample of the data. Bayesian methods are well suited to propagate and communicate the uncertainty in the model estimates.

According to the theory of price and demand, the demand for a good is mainly determined by its own price and the price of possible substitute goods [@pindyck_rubinfeld18]. Space heating is to be considered as an essential good, which is associated with a minimum demand in the winter months in order to ensure the well-being of residents. Furthermore, the production of space heating depends on the energetic conditions and heating technologies installed in a building, which cannot be easily replaced in the short-term. This is especially true for rental buildings, where the tenants usually have no direct say regarding renovation activities such as building insulation or a renewal of the heating system. Due to these reasons, the price elasticity of space heating demand can be assumed to be rather inelastic -- especially for the segment of rental buildings observed in this thesis. The theoretical assumption of a rather inelastic demand reaction is also confirmed by previous evidence from the literature. The majority of studies focusing on the specific energy application of space heating demand in the residential buildings sector arrive at estimates for the price elasticity of space heating demand in the range between -0.3 and -0.6 (see Chapter \@ref(review)).

The results of this thesis confirm the assumption that the demand for space heating is a highly inelastic. In the final model Specification in the analysis based on the full sample, the price elasticity was estimated such that the demand for space heating would decrease by -0.243% if the energy price increased by 1% (see Chapter \@ref(full-sample-results)). Thus, the estimated elasticity is even lower than in most previous studies. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis of the heterogeneity of the price response based on a subsample of the data and its formalization through the use of an interaction model found heterogeneity in the demand response of the different energy carrier groups. Buildings with oil heating are associated with the lowest demand elasticity of -0.16 [-0.10; -0.23] (Mean estimate [95%CI]), gas with an elasticity in the mid-range of -0.35 [-0.29; -0.40] and district heating with a still inelastic but higher elasticity of -0.53 [-0.46; -0.60].

Because the sample data is limited to the rental segment of the buildings sector, the price elasticity estimates presented in this thesis should be considered as an elasticity for this specific segment of the buildings sector. Due to the different conditions between the segments, it can be assumed that the price elasticities for single-family houses and for commercial properties are different from those for rented apartment buildings. By estimating an elasticity for the rental segment exclusively, this thesis addresses a gap mentioned in the literature [e.g., @braungardt_etal21]. For the wider policy context for decarbonising the residential buildings sector, the estimated highly inelastic demand reaction has the implication that households are price takers when it comes to price-related policy instruments for space heating, such as the carbon price signal induced by the BEHG. This means that households have to allocate a larger share of their budget to meeting their desired demand. And that this effect becomes even more relevant with rising energy prices. This effect is particularly relevant for the segment of rental buildings because under the current design of the BEHG renters are the sole recipients of the carbon price signal, in turn implying that owners have no incentive to improve the energetic conditions of a building or decarbonise the heat supply.

**Limitations**

- No socio-economic variables included in the model


**Further research**

The elasticity estimates from this thesis may also be relevant for other countries and regions that have comparable conditions to Germany in terms of building stock and energy demand and also face the challenge of decarbonising the buildings sector in the coming decades. Here, my results would serve as an empirical guide to the short-term demand effects for any kind of price-related policy instrument.

- Also estimate long-term elasticities (beyond the scope of this thesis) --> scrutinize the intuition that long-term elasticities are lower for the rental segment than for own homes.
