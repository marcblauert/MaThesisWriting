# Conclusion {#conclusion}

This thesis investigated short-term own-price elasticities of space heating demand based on a large-scale sample of energy bills in Germany between 2007 and 2019. Estimating the price elasticities of space heating demand is relevant as it is a key parameter for assessing the expected impact of price-related energy policy instruments, such as the newly introduced Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) 2021 in Germany. The novelty of this work is that it relies on energy billing data instead of social survey data, which provides a more accurate picture of energy demand and prices than previous studies, which usually use information on household expenditures and average price data from national statistics to derive demand [e.g., @rehdanz07; @schmitz_madlener20]. In addition, this thesis relies on a broad range of statistical methods and applies Bayesian regression analysis with a multilevel (partial pooling) approach with varying intercepts on a subsample of the data. Bayesian methods are well suited to propagate and communicate the uncertainty in the model estimates.

According to the theory of price and demand, the demand for a good is mainly determined by its own price and the price of possible substitute goods [@pindyck_rubinfeld18]. Space heating is to be considered an essential good, associated with a minimum demand in the winter months to ensure residents' well-being. Furthermore, the production of space heating depends on the energetic conditions and heating technologies installed in a building, which cannot be easily replaced in the short-term. This is especially true for rental buildings, where residents usually have no direct say regarding renovation activities such as building insulation or a heating system renewal. Due to these reasons, the price elasticity of space heating demand can be assumed to be relatively inelastic -- especially for the segment of rental buildings observed in this thesis. The theoretical assumption of a relatively inelastic demand reaction is also confirmed by previous evidence from the literature. Most studies focusing on the specific energy application of space heating demand in the residential buildings sector arrive at estimates for the price elasticity of space heating demand in the range between -0.3 and -0.6 (see Chapter \@ref(review)).

The results of this thesis confirm the assumption that the demand for space heating is highly inelastic. In the final model Specification in the analysis based on the full sample, the price elasticity was estimated such that the demand for space heating would decrease by -0.24% if the energy price increased by 1% (see Chapter \@ref(full-sample-results)). Thus, the estimated elasticity is even lower than in most previous studies. Furthermore, the analysis of the heterogeneity of the demand response based on a subsample of the data established heterogeneity between the different energy carrier groups. Buildings with oil heating are associated with the most inelastic demand response of -0.16 [-0.10; -0.23] (Mean estimate [95%CI]), gas with a mid-ranged response of -0.35 [-0.29; -0.40], and district heating with a still inelastic but higher response of -0.53 [-0.46; -0.60] (see Chapter \@ref(subsample-results)).

For the broader policy context for the decarbonisation of the residential buildings sector, the estimated highly inelastic demand response implies that households are price takers regarding price-related policy instruments for space heating. This entails that households have to spend a larger share of their budget to meet their desired demand for space heating and that this effect becomes even more relevant with increasing energy prices. This effect is particularly relevant for the rental building segment. Under the current design of the BEHG, renters are the sole recipients of the carbon price signal -- which in turn means that owners have no incentive to improve the energy conditions of a building or to decarbonise the heat supply. From a policy perspective, there is, therefore, a need to shift the carbon price signal, at least in part, to building owners to ensure that long-term investment in decarbonising the buildings sector is encouraged -- besides short-term demand responses from residents. In addition, carbon pricing in the building sector needs to be embedded in a broader policy mix to make the transition to a low-carbon building sector socially desirable and politically feasible. Accompanying and reinforcing instruments include regulatory measures such as the introduction of minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for buildings and roadmaps for a consecutive phase-out of the installation of new fossil-based heating technologies. As well as fiscal instruments to promote the energy-efficient renovation of the building stock and installation of renewable heating technologies [@uba22].

Since the sample data is limited to the rental segment of the buildings sector, the price elasticity estimates presented in this thesis should be considered elasticities for this specific segment. Due to varying conditions, one can assume that the price elasticities for single-family homes, self-owned apartment buildings, or commercial properties differ from those estimated here. By providing elasticity estimates for the rental segment alone, this paper fills a research gap identified in the literature [e.g., @braungardt_etal21]. Beyond Germany, the elasticity estimates from this work may also be relevant for researchers and policymakers in other countries and regions with comparable building stock, climatic conditions, and energy demand as Germany.

**Limitations and further research opportunities**

The main limitation related to this work is that it was impossible to control the socio-economic determinants of space heating demand at the household level. Previous studies show that household income, in particular, is a relevant determinant that could not be taken into account here. But also other factors such as the number of household members, age, or education may be relevant. At the same time, the billing data underlying this work has also offered an advantage over previous studies based on social surveys, as it provides specific energy demand and prices. Hence, it would be particularly valuable for future research if both specific energy demand and prices, on the one hand, and socio-economic factors, on the other hand, were collected at the household level. Such a comprehensive collection of data might be implemented in dedicated household panels, e.g. through the use of smart meters. Having both types of data together in one dataset would probably make it possible to produce even more reliable estimates of the price elasticity of space heating demand.

Another limitation that this thesis faces is the risk that the different price elasticities found between the energy carrier groups could be partly attributable to the higher share of fixed heating cost components at lower energy demand levels. Due to the absence of a breakdown of costs into fixed and variable parts, a more detailed investigation was not feasible.

A third limitation of the thesis is that the additional estimation based on an instrumental variable approach was attempted to address a potential simultaneity bias in the data, but was ultimately abandoned. This was because the identifying assumption for the instrument adopted from the literature was not met with the data underlying this thesis. In further research, one could address this concern by testing other instrumental variables also using the energy billing data.

Estimating the long-term price elasticities for the rental segment alone would be an interesting research question. Because this could confirm or reject the hypothesis that the long-term elasticities for the rental segment are not much higher than the short-term ones due to the limited incentives for owners to improve the energy condition of a building. In addition, the long-term estimates for the rental segment could also be compared with those of owner-occupied housing to see whether they are actually lower.
