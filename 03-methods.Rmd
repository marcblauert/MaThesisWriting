Csereklyei (2020):
It is widely anticipated that responses in electricity consumption to changes in prices will be rather slow, as it takes time for energy-using durable stock to change (Miller and Alberini, 2016). Thus, short-run or annual price elasticity estimates are expected to be rather inelastic, while one anticipates significantly larger long-run estimates.

Miller and Alberini (2016) furthermore report that the use of IV estimates can change the reported elasticities by up to 80%.

discrete decision to purchase durable goods that consume energy and the decision to consume energy is rarely considered. 
renovations may disturbe the picture the panel data provides

On the other hand, most empirical studies in this area have used single-equation econometric models that require separability re- strictions. This is a severe disadvantage as it is not possible to estimate cross-price effects between different energy products or consider the effects of non-energy products on the price elasticity of energy goods. 


Sample period. It is widely accepted that the economic cycle has a strong influence on energy consumption due to income and (indirect cycle-related) price effects. In the case of economic crises, for example, a depression of energy prices may occur; reduced dis- posable income may lead agents to reduce consumption through improvements in energy efficiency, adjustments to other types of consumption or changes towards other more inexpensive energy goods.


From Aufhammer wegen IV approach:
We instrument the utilities’ consumer-facing prices with the weekly average spot price of natural gas at a major natural gas distribution hub in Louisiana (the Henry Hub). This instrument is valid, as we know the formula of how utilities pass-through the price (providing a strong first stage), and the price is determined prior to within-bill consumption (strengthening the exclusion restriction).
