I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my two supervisors, Prof. Dr. Karsten Neuhoff and Prof. Dr. Tobias Krüger, for their supervision, valuable guidance, and feedback. Furthermore, I would also like to express special thanks to Dr. Franziska Schütze for the extensive discussions and many practical suggestions provided throughout the course of writing the thesis. This also applies to the lively discussions and feedback from other colleagues in the Climate Policy Department at DIW Berlin -- be it in personal conversations or during the joint Brownbag session. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Jan Stede, especially in the phase of exploring the initial research ideas. \par

Finally, I am truly grateful to my loved ones for their continued motivation and moral support. \par
