I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my two supervisors, Prof. Dr. Karsten Neuhoff and Prof. Dr. Tobias Krüger, for their supervision, valuable guidance, and feedback. My special thanks also go to Dr. Franziska Schütze for the elaborate discussions and her practical suggestions throughout the process. I am also grateful for the lively discussions and feedback from other colleagues in the Climate Policy Department at DIW Berlin -- both in personal conversations and during the joint Brownbag session. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Jan Stede, especially during the phase of exploring the initial research ideas.\par

Finally, I am genuinely grateful to my loved ones for their continued motivation and moral support.
