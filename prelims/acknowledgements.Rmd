 I would like to express my sincere thanks to my two supervisors, Prof. Dr. Karsten Neuhoff and Prof. Dr. Tobias Krüger, for their supervision and support during the preparation of this thesis. In addition, I would especially like to thank Dr. Franziska Schütze for the frequent in-depth discussions and the many valuable practical tips she gave me during the course of the work. The same applies to the fruitful discussions and the advice I received from all the other colleagues in the Climate Policy Department at DIW Berlin, either in person or as part of the joint Brownbag discussion. I would also like to thank the whole Climate Policy Department of DIW Berlin for being open to my thesis idea and for providing me with the data able to pursue it. This also includes the inspiration and support received by Dr. Jan Stede in the phase of developing the idea. \par
