Space heating demand of private households accounted for 13.6% of national primary energy demand in Germany in 2020. Due to its predominant generation from fossil fuels, space heating is also responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the residential buildings sector. To achieve ambitious climate targets, decarbonisation of the buildings sector represents a key challenge. Carbon pricing instruments, such as the newly introduced German Fuel Emissions Trading Act 2021, are vital to support the transformation of the buildings sector. However, to estimate the impact of price-related policy instruments, one must identify the magnitude of the demand response of private consumers to a price change for space heating. Therefore, this thesis uses a large-scale energy billing sample of multi-apartment buildings in Germany between 2007 and 2019 to produce estimates of the short-term own-price elasticity of space heating demand. The results show that the demand for space heating is highly inelastic. Based on a fixed-effects (FE) model and the full dataset of more than 2.7 million observations, a mean price elasticity of -0.24 is found. Furthermore, when relying on a random stratified subsample and analysing it with a Bayesian multilevel (partial pooling) model with varying intercepts, it is found that the different energy carrier groups are associated with different price elasticities of demand. Buildings with oil heating are associated with the most inelastic demand response of -0.16 [-0.10; -0.23] (Mean estimate [95%CI]), gas with a mid-ranged demand response of -0.35 [-0.29; -0.40] and district heating with a still inelastic but higher demand response of -0.53 [-0.46; -0.60]. The inelastic demand responses suggest that households need to allocate a larger share of their budgets to space heating when energy prices rise. For the policy context, the inelastic estimates, therefore, suggest that carbon pricing in the buildings sector needs to be embedded in a policy mix to make the transition to a low-carbon buildings sector socially desirable and politically feasible.\par
