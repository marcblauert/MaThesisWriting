Space heating demand of private households accounted for 13.6% of national primary energy demand in Germany in 2020. Due to its predominant generation from fossil fuels, space heating is also responsible for most of the residential buildings' greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). To achieve ambitious climate targets, decarbonisation of the buildings sector represents a key challenge. Carbon pricing instruments, such as the newly introduced German Fuel Emissions Trading Act 2021, are vital to support the transformation of the buildings sector. However, to estimate the impact of price-related policy instruments, the magnitude of the demand response of private consumers to a price change for space heating must be identified. Therefore, this thesis uses a large-scale energy billing sample of multi-apartment buildings in Germany between 2007 and 2019 to produce estimates of the short-term own-price elasticity of space heating demand. The results show that the demand for space heating is highly inelastic. A mean price elasticity of -0.24 is found relying on the full dataset. Furthermore, when relying on a random stratified subsample, it is found that the different energy carrier groups are associated with varying price elasticities of demand. Buildings with oil heating are associated with the lowest elasticity of -0.16 [-0.10; -0.23] (Mean estimate [95%CI]), gas with an elasticity in the mid-range of -0.35 [-0.29; -0.40] and district heating with a still inelastic but higher elasticity of -0.53 [-0.46; -0.60]. The inelastic demand responses suggest that households need to allocate a larger share of their budgets to space heating when energy prices rise. For the policy context, the inelastic estimates therefore suggest that carbon pricing in the building sector needs to be embedded in a policy mix to make the transition to a low-carbon building sector socially desirable and politically feasible.
