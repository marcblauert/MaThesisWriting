Space heating demand of private households accounted for 13.6% of national primary energy demand in Germany in 2020. Due to its predominant generation from fossil fuels, space heating is also responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the residential buildings sector. In order to achieve ambitious climate targets, decarbonisation of the buildings sector represents a key challenge. Carbon pricing instruments, such as the newly introduced German Fuel Emissions Trading Act 2021, are key instruments to support the transformation of the buildings sector. However, to estimate the effects of any price-related policy instrument, the price responsiveness of residential consumers for the demand of space heating needs to be identified. Therefore, this thesis uses a large-scale energy billing sample of multi-apartment buildings in Germany between 2007 and 2019 to produce estimates of the short-term price elasticity of space heating demand. The results of the analysis show that the demand for space heating is highly inelastic. An overall price elasticity of space heating demand of -0.243 is found relying on the full set of data. Furthermore, when relying on a random stratified subsample, it is found that the different energy carrier groups are associated with varying price elasticities of demand. Buildings with oil heating are associated with the lowest elasticity of -0.16 [-0.10; -0.23] (Mean estimate [95%CI]), gas with an elasticity in the mid-range of -0.35 [-0.29; -0.40] and district heating with a still inelastic but higher elasticity of -0.53 [-0.46; -0.60]. For the wider policy context, the inelastic estimates suggest that to achieve ambitious climate targets, carbon pricing in the buildings sector needs to be embedded in a policy mix to make the transition to a low-carbon buildings sector socially desirable and politically feasible.
