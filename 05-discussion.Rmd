NOTES - Energy taxation and climate change:
- Fuel consumption demand is determined by demand functions that depend primarily on income and prices
- Those who disfavor fuel taxes often claim they are strongly regressive. Earlier studies have shown that this depends on the country studied and on the details of the methods used, for instance if lifetime or temporary income is used, if substitution or other reactions are allowed for in the analysis. There is a tendency to progressivity in low income countries but regressivity in high income countries.
- Indirect channel of long-term price change and anticipation of those changes leading to investments in low-carbon UBA: Remediation measures drawn by lot through the BEHG are partly subsidized through the BEG or the tax incentive and are accounted for there (CO2 price as door opener for subsidy)
