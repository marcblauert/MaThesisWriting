# Discussion {#discussion}


NOTES - Energy taxation and climate change:
- Fuel consumption demand is determined by demand functions that depend primarily on income and prices
- Those who disfavor fuel taxes often claim they are strongly regressive. Earlier studies have shown that this depends on the country studied and on the details of the methods used, for instance if lifetime or temporary income is used, if substitution or other reactions are allowed for in the analysis. There is a tendency to progressivity in low income countries but regressivity in high income countries.
- Indirect channel of long-term price change and anticipation of those changes leading to investments in low-carbon UBA: Remediation measures drawn by lot through the BEHG are partly subsidized through the BEG or the tax incentive and are accounted for there (CO2 price as door opener for subsidy) 


## Discussion of elasticity results

## The role of energy prices and interaction with complementary measures


- For district heating larger share of costs are fixed; may drive the effect of larger price elasticities as data does not differentiate between fixed and variable cost components and with lower energy demand the per-unit cost rate increses due to the larger 

- Prices not the only option for action, potential overestimation of price relevance
- Warmmietenmodell (Now only the renters are effected which will mainly trigger short-term price reactions; for decarbonisation need to tap the long-term channel; Lessors must be incentivized to initialize efficiency measures; one option: split prices but then long-term price signal is still partly muted; Warmmietmodell as an alternative where both parties renters and lessors have full economic incentive of pricing measures)
