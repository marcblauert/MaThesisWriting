**Findings on the price elasticity of space heating demand**

The first research question to be answered in this thesis is: How does a change in the price of energy affect the level of space heating demand? In other words, to determine an reliable estimate of the price elasticity of space heating demand. The results presented previously confirm the assumption that the demand for space heating is a rather inelastic good. In the final model Specification in the analysis relying on the full sample, the estimated price elasticity was that for the average building in the sample, the demand for space heating would decrease by -0.243% if the price of energy increased by 1%. This implies that the estimated price elasticity using the whole set of data is lower than the estimates from previous studies focusing on Germany (see Chapter \@ref(review)). Interestingly, however, the estimated overall price elasticity matches the results of @auffhammer_rubin18, the only other study that also relies on energy billing data. The fact that the price elasticity estimates observed in the different model Specifications moved downwards when the grouping variables buildings and years were included either as fixed effects in the full sample or with a partial pooling approach for the Bayesian regression analysis of the subsample is consistent with findings also made by others in the literature [e.g., @miller_alberini16]. Due to the very large sample size of about 2.8 million observations in the full sample analysis and its inversely proportional relationship to the standard error of a model, the standard error of the price elasticity estimates is very small and does not necessarily reflect the true uncertainty and dispersion about the different combinations of price and demand observed in the data.

The results on the price elasticity of heating demand indicate that private households do adjust their demand levels in response to the incremental price changes observed in this thesis, but only to a relatively limited extent. This means that the direct impact of price-related policy instruments, such as the BEHG recently introduced in Germany for the building sector to price carbon externalities, is somewhat limited in the short-term. However, this statement is independent of the current price increases triggered by the gas shortage in Germany and Europe, where the price effects are so extreme that significant impacts on overall demand can be expected even in the short-term.

**Effects of other determinants on space heat demand**

The results from the full sample analysis are also suitable to discuss the second research question: What other determinants do affect the level space heating demand and need to be considered so that their effects are not falsely attributed to energy prices? The empirical analysis considered a set of additional variables, most of which showed a relevant association with the demand for space heating. The most relevant effect on the model results was clearly related to the inclusion of unobserved inter-individual differences between the units (buildings) and also an intra-individual dynamic over time (years) either trough fixed effects in the full sample analysis or trough the partial pooling approach in the subsample analysis. The model comparison conducted for the subsample analysis showed how significantly the model fit increased. Furthermore, the relatively minor effects on the price elasticity of demand when estimating the model Specifications with price as a sole predictor and then with the other variables included showed that the

## Integration into the Policy Context {#policy-context}

Der Verbrauch von Fernwärme lässt sich auch in Kubikmeter (m3) Gas umrechnen. Erdgas hat einen Heizwert von etwa 10 kWh/m3. 100 kWh entsprechen circa 10 m3 Erdgas. Es ist allerdings wenig sinnvoll, den Fernwärme-Verbrauch einfach in einen Gas-Verbrauch umzurechnen. Denn im Vergleich zu Erdgas oder Heizöl fallen keine zusätzlichen Verluste abhängig vom Wirkungsgrad des Kessels an. Daher ist der Fernwärmeverbrauch immer 10 bis 20 Prozent günstiger als bei fossilen Energieträgern. Besser vergleichen können Sie die durchschnittlichen Heizkosten pro m2 mit unseren Vergleichsartikeln.

. Given the robustness of these findings, this paper provides tight bounds on a policy-relevant parameter key to applications ranging from estimating the welfare benefits of fracking (Hausman and Kellogg 2015) to analyzing the regressivity of two-part tariffs (Borenstein and Davis 2012).


**Points from the literature (to be integrated)**

- Policy implication: Low elasticity estimates (lower than found in the previous literature) indicate that there is a strong need for a policy mix and carbon pricing must be accompanied by strong measures to induce THG reductions in the buildings sector

- In their analysis, @labandeira_etal17 include a total of 428 papers, all published between 1990 and 2016. For the demand of natural gas, they find an average short-term (long-term) price elasticity of -0.18 (-0.57) based on 230 individual estimates. And for heating oil they find a comparable average short-term (long-term) elasticity of -0.19 (-0.54), which, however, is based on only 44 individual estimates [@labandeira_etal17]. An average elasticity for space heating -- which is less focused on in the literature due to its relatively low prevalence -- is not provided.

- There are three earlier studies that have a spatial focus on Germany. The first study was conducted by @rehdanz07, who estimates short-term price elasticities for different energy carrier groups for residential space heating demand. She uses social survey data on household-level heating expenditures from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) in the years 1998 and 2003. Methodologically, a cross-sectional statistical analysis with dummy variables is conducted for the two years. In contrast to the  meta-estimates presented in the previous part of the Chapter, the study finds that demand for heating oil is highly elastic with estimates ranging between -1.68 and -2.03, depending on the model specification. For gas, the results indicate an inelastic elastic demand between -0.44 and -0.63 (depending on the model specification) which is nevertheless significantly more elastic than the meta-estimates presented previously. Therefore, the study concludes that the type of energy carrier can have a strong influence on the price sensitivity of households [@rehdanz07].


**The role of energy prices and interaction with complementary measures (policy-mix)**


- For district heating larger share of costs are fixed; may drive the effect of larger price elasticities as data does not differentiate between fixed and variable cost components and with lower energy demand the per-unit cost rate increses due to the larger 

- Prices not the only option for action, potential overestimation of price relevance

- Warmmietenmodell (Now only the renters are effected which will mainly trigger short-term price reactions; for decarbonisation need to tap the long-term channel; Lessors must be incentivized to initialize efficiency measures; one option: split prices but then long-term price signal is still partly muted; Warmmietmodell as an alternative where both parties renters and lessors have full economic incentive of pricing measures)


Relevance of Policy Mix - UBA (2022) study:

- Simulate the effect of various price paths for the BEHG until 2030 and simulate for the buildings sector (also consider the transportation and industry sector) how those varying price paths affect the level of sectoral emissions.

- Shortcoming: They do not consider demand effects from price changes --> short-term effects that this theses argues for; prices are only endogenous effects on the long-term investment desicions.

- Additional Shortcoming: Simulate choice of heat supply system, but not additional renovations, for example of the building envelope

- With the findings from this thesis it must therefore be assumed that actual emissions would be lower than simulated in the model not considering demand adjustments from higher energy prices

- Three scenarios: 1. BaU CO2 price of 125€/t in 2030; 2. Foresight, anticipation of energy prices for coming 5/10 yrs; 3. Foresight AND shorter lifetimes of heating systems (75% of usual life-time) for increased replacement.

- BaU: 86 Mt CO2e in 2030, KSG 2021 sector goal for buildings: 67 Mt CO2e in 2030; 28.4% above the target

- Only the scenarios with adjusted replacement rates + foresight meet or fall below the KSG (2021) targets (amended 2021 version).

- Anticipation of higher CO2 prices over long time span has high impact; but effect about three times as large when combined with shorter lifetimes of heating systems

- In scenarios with the assumption that heat supply systems are replaced more quickly due to the rising CO2 price, the heating replacement rate increases to around 5%. In sensitivities in which no shorter lifetimes of the heat supply systems are assumed, the heating replacement rate is significantly lower.

- Investitionsentscheidungen sind bedarfsgetrieben --> Policy Mix kann hier abhilfe Schaffen (bonus-malus system)

- Another key finding is that significantly greater savings can be achieved if the capital good is replaced before the end of its respective service life. Due to the long-term capital stocks, the effects are greatest in the buildings and industry sectors, while in the transport sector the additional effect of early replacement is limited due to the comparatively short holding periods of vehicles.

- Zusammenspiel: nur wenn fossile Investitionsgüter wirtschaftlich unattraktiv sind, wird durch die Austauschratenerhöhung die gewünschte Wirkung erzielt. Zusätzloiche Maßnahmen könnten sein: Verbesserung von Informationsverfügbarkeit, Ordnungsrecht oder finanzielle Förderungen. Besondere Bedeutung ist dabei einem verlässlich kommunizierten Preispfad des BEHG zuzumessen.

- Das im Rahmen der aktuellen Beratungen zum Fit-for-55-Paket der EU zu erwartende verschärfte, neue ESR-Ziel wie auch die daraus abgeleitete neue BEHG-Höchstmenge wird in keiner CO2-Preissensitivität eingehalten.--> Einhaltung der ambitionierteren BEHG-Ziele höhere CO2-Preise als hier analysiert zu erwarten sind bzw. darüberhinausgehende klimapolitische Instrumente erforderlich sind

- Damit bestätigt sich mit dieser Modellierungsarbeit auch die wirtschaftstheoretische Herleitung (vgl. Kemfert et al. (2021)), dass zur Erreichung der Klimaschutzziele ein Politik-Mix zielführend ist, welcher die CO2-Bepreisung mit ordnungsrechtlichen Instrumenten, Förderprogrammen und weiteren Instrumenten (z.B. dem Abbau klimaschädlicher Subventionen) kombiniert.







All the models described represent the conditional demand. It therefore has to be inferred that the results reflect the short-term price elasticities of demand. The use of other dynamic estimation approaches to estimate long-term elasticities, as for example @alberini_etal11 or @csereklyei20 have done, would go beyond the scope of this thesis and are therefore not pursued. Additionally, the short-term price elasticities estimated here may also be viewed as lower bound estimates of the price responsiveness compared to the usually higher long-term estimates. As they are a lower bound estimate, they can also be considered as a conservative estimate for any kind of modelling or policy advice for which they might be used.
